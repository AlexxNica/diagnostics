Node.js tracing - AsyncWrap
================================================================================

AsyncWrap is the central location in Node.js that handles async things
specific to Node.js.  As such, it's a likely place where tracing will be
desired.  Should serve as a good customer of the more general tracing story for
Node.js.

An older-ish intro to AsyncWrap is available in Trevor Norris's blog post
[AsyncWrap Tutorial - An Introduction](http://blog.trevnorris.com/2015/02/asyncwrap-tutorial-introduction.html).

There was also some discussion in [issue #21](https://github.com/nodejs/tracing-wg/issues/21#issuecomment-142727693).
